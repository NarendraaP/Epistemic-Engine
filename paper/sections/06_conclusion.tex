\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Contributions}

% Summarize the 3 main contributions:
% 1. Theoretical: The 3 epistemic invariants as a constitutional framework
% 2. System: Four-plane architecture (Truth Store, Adjudicator, Export, Viewer)
% 3. Empirical: Case studies demonstrating enforcement across 13 orders of magnitude

\subsection{Limitations}

% Be honest about what we haven't solved:
% - Full Gaia DR3 (1.8 billion stars) requires C++ renderer
% - No streaming LOD system yet (pre-export only)
% - Limited user testing
% - OpenSpace dependency

\subsection{Future Work}

% - Production C++ point cloud renderer
% - Real-time streaming from PostgreSQL
% - Comparative user study (epistemic vs. blended visualizations)
% - Extension to other domains (medical imaging, climate data)

\subsection{Broader Impact}

% Why this matters:
% - Education: Students deserve to know what's real
% - Public trust in science
% - Visualization ethics

% Final statement: "Show me the universe as it is, not as I wish it to be."
